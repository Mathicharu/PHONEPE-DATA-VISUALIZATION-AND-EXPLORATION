          The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

Data Extraction:  Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a POSTGRESQL database.

Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
